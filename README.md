# Landing Page Project

Simple project displaying beginner javascript skills

Added functionality to the template:
- a menu is generated from the html code
- page scrolls to the section selected via the menu
- the 'in view' section becomes 'active' ie gets another background color
- after 5 seconds (more or less) of inactivity, the menu disappears
- scrolling will reset the timeout for menu disappearance
